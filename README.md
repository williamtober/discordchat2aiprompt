# discordchat2aiprompt
lets try to train an ai to talk like our friends


## first things first, we need to get discord chat data...
this might be against tos so do it at your own risk 

- get the discord chat exporter from [here](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter)
- follow the prompt and get all the text from one person. 
- save the file in the root project directory

## setup your environment
```
prompter=yourusername
responder=yourfriendsusername
OPENAI_API_KEY=yourapikey
MODE_NAME=yourdesiredmodelname
ENGINE=yourdesiredengine (i.e. davinci)
```

## follow the prompt

- prep your data
- upload it
- create model
- check periodically on it

## TODO
first of all finish the modules, test em, add live status on the front index of the existing module.. so that we can see when the training is done
